In this project, i would like to demonstate synchronized and unsynchronized bank transactions.
So , i will create 100 bank accounts and transfer random amount of money from one account to another in an infinite loop.
so, when a transaction occurs the money gets debited from one account and credited to another account. But, the overall money( total of all accounts) should remain same.
I will print the total bank's balance after every transaction.
You can see the difference in the output.
